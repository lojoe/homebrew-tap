# homebrew-tap
Homebrew formula for my stuff and other stuff I like that's not already in a tap


## Using my tap

First, you need to have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) installed on your Mac.

Then, you can add my tap and install one or more formula:

```bash
brew tap lojoe/tap
brew install git-web
```

It's that easy!
